# R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

# Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
# Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
# Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
# Text (or string) values are called characters.

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE

## how to check datatypes
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric) # numeric

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character) # character


# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical) # logical
